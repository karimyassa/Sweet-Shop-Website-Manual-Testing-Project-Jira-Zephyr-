# Open the Browse Sweets page.
# Add the same sweet multiple times (e.g., add “Chocolate Cups” three times).
# Go to the Basket page.
# Observe the available actions for managing quantities.

*Expected Results:*
The basket should allow users to modify the quantity of an item — including increasing or decreasing the number of units — without having to remove the item completely.
